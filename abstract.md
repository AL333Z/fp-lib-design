The Functional Programming ecosystem in Scala is better than ever, and teams around the world are enjoying its amazing productivity boost.

Developers can use purely functional building blocks and purely functional libraries without any friction, and without sacrificing any business need.

But what happens when there's a need which is not covered (yet) by an existing library?

In this session, we'll see how to overcome these occurrences by:
- introducing a problem to talk about: working with a Java library
- introducing and using a bunch of building blocks to bring the library in our conform zone
- sketching the desired high-level design iteratively, evaluating and evolving toward a solution that is correct and simple to use
